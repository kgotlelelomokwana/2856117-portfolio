            <h3>Latest Project</h3>
            <p>
                One of my recent projects was a static website using all HTML, CSS and JavaScript. An ongoing projectI am busy with is a Chat website that help people connect based on their music taste and share playlists and other personal insights. I chose to do that particular project because it exposes me to database working and gets me familiar with  the uses of API's
